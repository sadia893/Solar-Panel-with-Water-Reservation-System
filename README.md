# Solar-Panel-with-Water-Reservation-System

**Objective**
The objective of the project is to make a system where solar panel in the rooftop along with water reservoir under it are used for multipurpose in the ever-growing busy cities.
Normally when there is sunlight and no rain, solar panel will do its usual job, reserving electricity. But when there is rain, solar panels’ shaft will close together, making space for the reservoir to collect rain water. When the water tank is full then some water will be moved by pipe to the garden trees.
Collected electricity and water can be used for further purposes on the rooftop.



**Required Components**
These following parts and tools are required for building this project
• Arduino UNO
• LCD 32*2
• Battery
• 1 Inch pipe (25 feet)
• Jumper Wires
• Hardboard Sheet
• Servo Motors
• Light Sensor
• Rain Sensor
• Ultrasonic Sensor
• Solar Panel



**Working Procedure**
The basic components that react to the input are:
• Servo Motors (Panel and Valve)
• LCD 32*2 display
The components that take stimuli from the environment is:
• Rain Sensor
• Light Sensor
• Solar Panel
• Ultrasonic Sensor



**Procedure:**
 Rain Sensor will be used to determine whether it is raining or not .We will also use a Light Sensor to detect the sunlight.
 When it is not raining and there is sunlight detected, the Solar Panel will get open widely on the water reservoir.
 When rain is detected, the Solar Panel gets close automatically with the help of the Servo Motors. And that’s how we will collect pure rain water in the reservoir.
 The Solar Panel will be opened at night if it is not raining for avoiding unwanted dirt or pollute in the water.
 We will use the electric power, consumed from the Solar Panel for running the Servo Motors.
 User can see whether the Solar panel is charging or not via LCD and also the power it has in different time of the day considering the various amount of sunlight. They can also see whether the tank is full or not.
 If the tank becomes full then another Servo Motor, working as a valve, is opened and water goes to the central big container and later can be used for watering the roof garden via pipes.
